# Library-GUI

A simple Python GUI application that allows users to search books stored in a JSON file â€” by book title or by author name.

### ðŸ“Œ Overview

Library-GUI is a desktop application built with Python (likely using a GUI toolkit, e.g. Tkinter or PyQt). It provides a friendly graphical interface so users can:
